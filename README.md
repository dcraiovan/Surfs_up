# Surfs_up
Module 9 Challenge

## Overview of the analysis
This analysis looks into temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii. This is done in order to determine if a surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round int he region.

In order to explore the data in the SQLite database, we used SQLAlchemy to connect and generate queries to pull the necessary information needed for our analysis. Throughout this module, we used Jupiter notebook to import dependencies and create the commands to pull the data from the SQLite database.

## Results
When looking at the observations that were recorded in the month of June and December regardless of year, the results showed:

- The average temperature is in the 70's.
- Both June and December showed similar min/max and average temperatures.
- The assumption is that the temperature does not have dramatic fluctuations throughout the year.
